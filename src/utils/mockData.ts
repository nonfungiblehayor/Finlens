        "text": "**Methodology**\n\nTo identify the best-selling products, I will first parse each transaction record. The \'Product(s)\' field often contains multiple products separated by semicolons. I will split this field for each transaction to get a list of individual products associated with that transaction. Due to the structure of the data (transaction revenue is listed as a total for the transaction, not per product item, and explicit quantities per product are not provided), I will treat each mention of a product within a transaction as one \'instance\' sold for quantity analysis. For revenue analysis, I will associate the total transaction revenue with *each* product listed within that transaction. This approach allows us to see which products are frequently part of transactions and which products are associated with high-value transactions, acknowledging the limitation that this isn\'t a true unit quantity or individual product revenue breakdown.\n\nI will aggregate the \'instance count\' (as a proxy for quantity) and the sum of associated transaction revenues for each unique product across all records. Finally, I will sort the products based on these aggregated metrics in descending order to identify the top performers.\n\n**Results**\n\n| Product Name                    | Transaction Count (Proxy for Quantity) | Total Associated Revenue |\n| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |\n| Coconut milk                    | 9                                      | 14710                    |\n| Detol Soap Small (pcs)          | 8                                      | 2400                     |\n| Bread                           | 4                                      | 23000                    |\n| Golden Penny Noodles (Small)    | 4                                      | 4300                     |\n| Beetroot ~1 kg                  | 2                                      | 6800                     |\n| Chi Chicken Breast ~1 kg - Frozen | 2                                      | 0                        |\n| Arla Mozzarella Cheese ~200 g   | 2                                      | 53194.05                 |\n| Maggi                           | 2                                      | 20                       |\n| New Age Power Bank              | 1                                      | 0                        |\n| Detol Morn Big Size             | 1                                      | 84000                    |\

This suggests \'Coconut milk\' and \'Detol Soap Small (pcs)\' are popular staple items.\n*   **By Associated Revenue:** \'Detol Morn Big Size\' is associated with the highest total revenue (84000), despite appearing in only one transaction. \'Arla Mozzarella Cheese ~200 g\' is second (53194.05 from 2 transactions), and \'Bread\' is third (23000 from 4 transactions). This indicates that while \'Coconut milk\' is popular by count, \'Detol Morn Big Size\', \'Arla Mozzarella Cheese ~200 g\', and \'Bread\' are involved in much higher-value transactions.\n\n**Important Limitation:** The current data structure does not allow for calculating the exact quantity of each item sold in transactions where multiple items are listed, nor does it provide the individual revenue contribution of each item in a multi-item transaction. The revenue figure provided per record is the total transaction value. Therefore, the \'quantity\' here reflects transaction count (how many transactions a product was in), and \'Total Associated Revenue\' is the sum of total transaction revenues for records containing that product. This overstates the revenue directly attributable *to* that specific product, especially for items frequently bundled with expensive items. For example, \'Chi Chicken Breast ~1 kg - Frozen\' and \'New Age Power Bank\' appear in transactions with revenue 0, likely because they were bundled with other items whose revenue is listed. To get a true picture of best sellers by unit quantity and individual revenue, the data would need to be structured differently, perhaps with each row representing a single product item line within a transaction, including its specific quantity and price.\n\nGiven this limitation, the current findings indicate product popularity in terms of transactional frequency and association with transaction value, rather than true sales volume and direct revenue contribution per product unit.",

Looking at the average transaction value per date reveals significant variability. There are some dates with a high average transaction value (e.g., 2025-02-20 at 84000.00, 2025-04-22 at 18198.02, 2025-03-07 at 10000.00), driven by one or more high-value transactions on those days. Conversely, there are dates with very low or zero average values (e.g., 2025-05-02, 2025-04-18, 2025-02-16 at 0.00, 2025-02-09 at 20.00, 2025-01-29 at 314.29). The presence of zero-revenue transactions warrants investigation; these might represent bundled items whose revenue was attributed elsewhere, exchanges, or data entry errors. The trend over time is highly volatile with no clear consistent upward or downward pattern in the daily average value across the observed dates, likely influenced heavily by infrequent large transactions. To smooth this volatility and potentially see a trend, analyzing the average transaction value over longer periods (e.g., weekly or monthly) would be beneficial, but the dataset doesn\'t contain enough dates for this level of aggregation.\n\nData quality issue: The presence of transactions with 0 revenue impacts the average transaction value calculation and warrants investigation to understand the nature of these records.",

        "text": "**Methodology**\n\nTo determine the distribution of payment modes, I will count the occurrences of each unique value in the \'Payment Mode\' column. I will then calculate the total number of transactions. For each payment mode, I will divide its count by the total transaction count and multiply by 100 to get the percentage share of transactions for that mode. This will show the popularity of each payment method.\n\n**Results**\n\n| Payment Mode  | Transaction Count | Percentage Share (%) |\n| :------------ | :---------------- | :------------------- |\n| cash          | 8                 | 30.77                |\n| credit        | 7                 | 26.92                |\n| POS           | 7                 | 26.92                |\n| bank_transfer | 4                 | 15.38                |\n| Unknown       | 0                 | 0.00                 |\n\n**Findings & Interpretations**\n\nThe analysis of payment modes shows that \'cash\' is the most frequently used payment method, accounting for just over 30% of transactions. \'credit\' and \'POS\' are equally popular, each making up approximately 26.9% of transactions. \'bank_transfer\' is the least frequent mode among the ones recorded, representing about 15.4% of transactions. There were no transactions with an \'Unknown\' payment mode based on the provided data.\n\nThe distribution is relatively balanced across cash, credit, and POS, suggesting customers utilize a variety of methods. The slightly higher share of cash transactions might indicate a preference for traditional payment or could be influenced by the types of products typically purchased using cash. Understanding the transaction value associated with each payment mode would provide deeper insight (e.g., are high-value transactions more likely to use credit/bank transfer?).\n\nActionable Insight: Monitor the costs associated with different payment modes (e.g., transaction fees for credit/POS/bank transfers vs. handling costs for cash) to optimize payment processing strategies.",
